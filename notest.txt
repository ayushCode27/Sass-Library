- Order of sass import files on index.scss does matter. Sass compiler, compiles from top to bottom.
- "_" before scss files, we are creating a partial, telling sass compiler not to compile code inside it to separate css
- using *.scss we are telling compiler that any file with scss extension need to be compiled into separate css file.
- '$' - Sass variable
- using scss file in link will work, but only valid css will be recognized.
- we can use '/' in variables, for css property we need "@use 'sass:math'" package and math.div(dividend, divisor)
- for debugging we can use "@debug expression"
- We can use loops 'in' and 'for' to iterate over maps.
- use '@if' and'@else' to apply conditions.
- use '&:hover' for pseudo classes.
