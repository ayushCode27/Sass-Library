- Order of sass import files on index.scss does matter. Sass compiler, compiles from top to bottom.
- "_" before scss files, we are creating a partial, telling sass compiler not to compile code inside it to separate css
- using *.scss we are telling compiler that any file with scss extension need to be compiled into separate css file.
- '$' - Sass variable
- using scss file in link will work, but only valid css will be recognized.
- we can use '/' a division operator in variables, for css property we need "@use 'sass:math'" package and math.div(dividend, divisor)
- debugging = we can use "@debug expression"
- loops = 'in' and 'for' to iterate over maps.
- conditions = '@if' and'@else'
- pseudo classes = '&:hover'
- mixins = "@mixin btn(){}" - to bound number of properties together, we can also pass arguments
- functions = '@function' for defining function, take input provides output (for calculations).
- media query = @content;
